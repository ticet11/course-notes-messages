                <p class="question">What is lodash?</p>

                <p class="answer">
                    Lodash is a JavaScript library that offers certain
                    utility functions that are commonly needed in

                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                    The debugger is a tool that allows you to start
                    and pause a JavaScript function between each step.
                    It also makes clear the value of certain variables
                    that are present in the function.

                                    super(errorMessage);
                                    this.name = 'VeryCoolError';

                <p class="answer">
                    npm is a software registry. Users can post
                    sections of code that other users can download and
                    install within their own system or program.

                    How do you create a local repository?
                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                    Within the terminal, navigate to the root folder
                    you wish to initialize and use the following
                    command:

                <p class="question">What is github?</p>

                <p class="answer">
                    GitHub is a git repository hosting service. If
                    your system crashes, you'll have a backup on
                    GitHub. It also makes it much easier to have
                    several people working on the same project by
                    allowing access to the repository to other users.
                </p>

                <p class="question">
                    How would you push a git repo to github?
                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                    You will have initialized a local repository
                    before attempting this:<br />
                    1. Select 'New repository' from the '+' dropdown
                    menu in the top right corner.<br />
                    <img src="images/repo-create.png" alt="" /><br />
                    2. Name your repository. (Naming it the same as
                    the root folder can be a good organizational
                    decision)<br />
                    <img
                        src="images/create-repository-name.png"
                        alt=""
                    /><br />
                    3. Click the 'Create repository' button.<br />
                    <img
                        src="images/create-repo-btn.png"
                        alt=""
                    /><br />
                    4. Copy text from this box.<br />
                    <img src="images/push-repo.png" alt="" /><br />
                    5. Paste into your terminal and execute.<br />

                </p>

                <p class="question">
                    What are the steps to make a git commit?
                </p>

                <div class="answer code">
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            $ git add .
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>Collects all files that have been changed.</p>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            $ git commit -m "Put commit message in these quotes."
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        Adds a message to all of your files that were
                        updated since last commit.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p class="question">
                    How would you hide files from git?
                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                    Create a file called '.gitignore'. Within that
                    file, type the names of all folders and files you
                    wish to be ignored when you make commits.
                </p>

                <p class="question">
                    Why would you want to hide files from git?
                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                    Sometimes the files in your program contain
                    sensitive information or information that is
                    specific to your system, so you don't want them to
                    be made public in the repository.
                </p>

                <p class="question">What does git pull do?</p>

                <p class="answer">
                    Git pull retrieves the most current repository
                    from your source and merges it to your currently
                    selected branch.
                </p>

                <p class="question">
                    What is the purpose of git branches?
                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                    Creating a new branch allows you to edit files and
                    save it's data while preserving the master branch,
                    so you won't lose working versions of the app
                    while working on different features.
                </p>

                <p class="question">
                    How would you push a git branch to github?
                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                    As long as you're located in the branch on your
                    system, when you push as normal you will be
                    pushing up your branch so that it can be seperatly
                    accessed.
                </p>

                <p class="question">
                    Explain how to merge a remote branch.
                </p>

                <p class="answer">Merge a remote branch with what?</p>

                <p class="question">What is git rebase?</p>

                <p class="answer">
                    A git rebase would be used in a situation where
                    someone created a feature branch. After that
                    branch was created, the master branch received
                    another commit. With a rebase you can bring your
                    feature branch up to date with the master branch
                    while still keeping it seperate.
                </p>

                <p class="question">What is git stash?</p>

                <p class="answer">
                    With git stash, you can checkout of a branch
                    without commiting in a way that will not bring all
                    the new data onto a branch it doesn't belong on.
                </p>

                <p class="question">
                    What is the difference between git fetch and git
                    pull?
                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                    Git pull automatically merges the retrived version
                    with your currently active local branch.<br />
                    Git fetch retrieves the remote version without
                    merging the two versions.
                </p>

                <p class="question">What is a merge conflict?</p>

                <p class="answer">
                    A merge conflict occurs when you try to merge 2
                    branches when both had the same block of code
                    edited in different ways.
                </p>

                <p class="question">
                    How can a merge conflict occur?
                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                    If 2 collaborators were both working on the same
                    code or if someone was working on the master
                    branch instead of a seperate feature branch, etc.
                    It could really happen in a lot of situations
                    where people aren't careful.

                <p class="answer">
                    The document is loaded within the window object.
                    The object includes the actual documents being

                <p class="question">What are query selectors?</p>

                <p class="answer">
                    Query secectors allow you to search through your
                    document with several different properties as
                    parameters.

                    What are JavaScript event listeners?
                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                    Event listeners allow you to select a trigger that
                    will start different functions, such as if
                    something is clicked on or is hovered over.

                <p class="answer">
                    'onclick' tells the HTML to start a JavaScript
                    function when the item is clicked.
                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                    'onclick' is an inline HTML attribute.

                </p>

                <p class="answer">The toggle function allows you to use an event listener that will add a class and then remove a class if the event listener is triggered twice. It could be implemented like this:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            itemClicked.addEventListener('click', () => {
                                itemToBeSeen.classList.toggle('classToToggle');
                            });
                        </code>
                    </pre>
