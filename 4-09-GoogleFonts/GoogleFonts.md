### New Google Fonts

I didn't want to take up more of the class time, since we moved on, but I played around more with the google fonts. When you choose, a font-weight, it seems to be just the default, because I was still able to change the font-weight with the css. Also, generally, [standard font-weight is 400](https://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/TestSuite/results/4/XEP/bold.pdf).
