                    Structural Diagrams show the structure, of course.
                    They depict which elements are related to which
                    and how everything connects.

                <p>
                    Behavioral Diagrams show how a system is supposed
                    to behave. It shows the dynamic aspects of the

                    Graphical depiction of a workflow. It should
                    account for user decisions, iterations in the

                    Use Case Diagrams show all of the actions a user
                    can take with your application and how those

                <p>
                    Sequence diagrams show how the different objects
                    and classes interact, send and receive messages,
                    to make a certain scenario or use case work.

                <h2>What are UML State Machine Diagrams?</h2>
                <p>
                    Show's all relevant activities and objects
                    involved in changing the overall state of your
                    program. For example, if you were making a state
                    machine diagram for your keyboard, you may
                    consider upper and lowercase letters. With the
                    CapsLock key, you can put your keyboard in one of
                    two states. Other buttons could be pressed that
                    would not effect this state.
